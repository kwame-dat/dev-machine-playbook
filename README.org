Uses [[https://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]] to provision and setup my development machine from scratch so I
don't have to do things manually.

I personally enjoy working on a arch based Linux distribution. However from time
to time I come across situation where I need to work on Ubuntu, MacOs or WSL.

Hence I plan to support the following Operating Systems;
- [X] [[https://arcolinux.com/][ArcoLinux (Arch Linux)]]
- [ ] [[https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/big-sur/][MacOs]]
- [X] [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu (Debian)]]
- [ ] [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10][Windows (WSL Ubuntu)]]
** Provisioning
#+begin_src sh
  make provision
#+end_src

** Development
*** Prerequisite
- vagrant
